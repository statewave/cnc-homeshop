## Squareness Semicircles

You can square your machine by cutting round holes, inserting pins, and
measuring their diagonals using calipers.  That's in the `squareness_pins`
directory alongside this.

If you'd rather just measure your workpiece directly, this is an efficient way
to get a corner that you can fit your caliper tips into.
